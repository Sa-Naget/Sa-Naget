A kinda curious teenager who's now learning Python, Front-end, and Cybersecurity :3 a student at a Vocational High School with Informatics Engineer as my major (◔◡◔)
I use github mainly for practice, archive of my simple project, or fun purpose ✨

- I also spent most of my free time reading any type of literature and writing a little story about my fictional character ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡
